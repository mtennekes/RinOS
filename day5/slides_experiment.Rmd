## Why synthetic populations?

- methods comparison (e.g design-based simulation studies)

- policy modelling on individual level (e.g health planning, climate change,
demographic change, economic change, …)

- teaching (e.g.teaching of survey methods)

- Creation of public-/scientific-use fileswith lowdisclosure risk
data availability is often a problem (legal issues, costs,…)

## Close-to-reality data

- actual sizes of regions and strata need to be reflected
marginal distributions and interactions between variables should be represented
correctly
- hierarchical and cluster structures have to be preserved
Data confidentiality must be ensured
- Pure replication of units from the underlying sample should be avoided
Sometimes some marginal distributions must exactly match known values

## Approaches

- choice of methods highly depends on available information survey samples

- aggregated information from samples known marginal distributions from population

## R package `simPop`

- in `simPop`: model-based approach is forced
- Helps to generate synthetic populations, having similar properties as the real population.
