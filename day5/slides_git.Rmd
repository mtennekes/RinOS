## Reproducability

### 

- As an official statistician your actions/data manipulations 
should be reproducible:

- Actions **repeatable**: same data in, identical analysis out.
- Actions **comparable**: new data in, comparable analysis out.
- Actions **improvable**: same data in, better analysis out. 
- Actions **readable**: do you (and I!) understand what the action is about?


## Typical development cycle:

- Design data processing script for production (good!):
- In production you encounter unforeseen errors or changes in data (_reality is messy_)
- So you should allow for incremental improvements and debugging

## Version control

- What is version control?

### Software enginering trick

- keep track of changes in source code (files)
- work in teams on large sets on source code
- make it easy to rollback changes (also partially)
- focussed on source code (scripts!)

## Version control

- Why is it important?

    - For yourself!
    - To share scripts with others.
    - To work in a team on the same project.

## For yourself!

### Be reproducible!

- Keep explicit track of versions (history).
- Can always return to a any version of your scripts
- As a result: scripts cleaner.
- ~Erorz kan be undon~
- Errors can be undone.

## Sharing scripts

- The internet contains lots of example scripts / source code 
- All these scripts are under source control

    - http://github.com
    - http://gitlab.com
    - http://bitbucket.org
    
- If you share those scripts with someone, it is handy to have version control, when
something changes. 

## Team work / Professional

- As a official statisticina / data scientist you often work in teams.
- In a professional setting, the script is not yours, it should be accessable to
current and future colleagues.

### Version control allows for developing scripts together
- changes are made individually (in parallel)
- version control software helps to integrate these versions.

## `git`

- Most used tool is `git`
- Installation: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

### History

- Written by  Linus Torvalds (inventor of Linux)
- To support Linux development.
- Decentral management of source code.

## Tools

### How to use it? 

- CLI (command-line), good (but complex...)

### In IDE 
- Well integrated
- RStudio (for *R*)
- VS Code (visual studio code) (can be used with R!)
- Python (Spyder IDE etc.)

## Do and Don'ts

- `git` is a good tool, but use it for : 

### Do's

- Scripts!
- Configuration files.
- Text files.
- (small) data files

### Don't

- Continuously changing data files
- Continuously changing binary files
  
  - e.g. Excel, word etc

**git is optimized for changes in lines of text**

## Advantages

###

`git`:

- is fast!
- can work offline. (does not need a server)
- keeps track of all versions you explicitly _commit_.
- allows for returning to previous version. 

## Difference with dropbox / snap shots

- May look like dropbox / google drive

### Use case is different:

- `git` supports teams
- decentral development and integration of applications



## Why?

###

- `git` optimized for keeping track of changes in text. 
- `git` stores difference between lines texts (efficiently)

## `git` workflow

\end{center}

## `git` terms

- `repo`: repository, copy of all version history, kept in a (hidden) `.git` 
sub directory

- `commit`: command to store a version.

- `push`: push your projects history to another git repo

- `pull`: retrieve the history of another repo.

## Sharing / team work

###

- Every repo is a full copy (with complete history)
- `git` support all kinds of scenario for sharing/managing the code.
- Both central as well as decentral.
- Also  _federated model_ (army like structure)

## Remote repo's model

## Central repo model

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\paperwidth]{fig/03.png}
\end{center}

## Configuration (once)

Git keeps track which user has work on the code, so we should declare ourselves
to `git` using an email name (which is unique) 

```sh
git config --global user.email "name@email.com"
```
```sh
git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
```

Checking if configuration was succesful:

```sh
git config --global --list 
```

## Commands

### Initialise

Once (for a project directory)

```
git init
```

### Add files to tracking:

```
git add <file1> <file2> <dir1> .... 
```

### Commit changes:

```
git commit -am 'text'

```

## Remote

It is possible to use `git` with a centrale/remote repo: you should consider this 
in your organisation.

A central repo:

- can be just a network drive
- can be on a website:
  
    - external: github.com, gitlab.com 
    - internal: gitea, gitlab (requires installation of server in your organisation)

- Note every copy of the repo is a full copy!


## Remote commando's 

- Adding a centrale repo (once)
```
git remote add origin <url>
```

- Or clone a already existing central repo:
```
git clone <url> <dir>
```

- Retrieve the latest changes from the central repo
```
git pull origin
```

- Push your changes to the central repo.
```
git push origin
```
