### Exercise 1

Look the file `un-report.pdf`. We are recreating this document
using `rmarkdown` in html (of pdf if you want to).

Some clues: 

- **All numbers, including numbers in the texts should be generated with R code**
- Download cheatsheets for `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `rmarkdown`
- Create a new RStudio project for this report. Make sure the data (`Unitednations.txt`) is in the project directory.
- You will need to use `tidyverse`
- Work iteratively, add a litte piece at a time and `knit` to see if it works.
- Some command may generate a `warning` or `message`, search in the help (e.g. Google) how 
to turn this off.
- The tables are created with `pander`. Find out how to change the _caption_.
