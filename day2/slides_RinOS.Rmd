## R use in Official Statistics

R is used more and more in statistical offices

Reasons:

- popular analytical tool
- new employees are familiar with it
- cheaper (e.g. IStat (Italy) saves 1M euro a year)
- many packages available 
- active community, also for Official Statistics!


## Official Statistics Usages:

- analyzing data (analyst)
- production of statistics e.g. HSMR in NL (mortality rate)
- checking and validating data.
- business cycle tracer, using time series analysis
- publishing dashboards: e.g. http://dashboards.cbs.nl

## Official Stats R Packages: Sampling (GSBPM 4.1)
- `sampling`. Several algorithms for drawing (complex) survey samples and calibrating design weights.
- `surveyplanning`. Tools for sample survey planning, including sample size calculation, estimation of expected precision for the estimates of totals, and calculation of optimal sample size allocation.


## Official Stats R Packages: Process (GSBPM 5)

\scriptsize

- `blaise` Reading and writing Files in the Blaise Format from R. By Statistics Netherlands.
- `dcmodify` Derive new variables or modify data using externally defined data modification rules.
- `reclin` Functions to assist in performing probabilistic record linkage and deduplication: generating pairs, comparing records, em-algorithm for estimating m- and u-probabilities, forcing one-to-one matching. Can also be used for pre- and post-processing for machine learning methods for record linkage.
- `RecordLinkage`. Implementation of the Fellegi-Sunter method for record linkage.
- `StatMatch`. Statistical Matching or Data Fusion
- `fastLink`. Implements a Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model that allows for missing data and the inclusion of auxiliary information. Documentation can be found on http://imai.princeton.edu/research/linkage.html

##

\scriptsize

- `stringdist`. Implements approximate string matching. Supports various string distances (Damerau-Levenshtein, Hamming, Levenshtein, optimal sting alignment), qgrams (q- gram, cosine, jaccard distance) and heuristic metrics (Jaro, Jaro-Winkler). An implementation of soundex is provided as well.
- `fuzzyjoin`. Join tables based on exact or similar matches. Allows for matching records based on inaccurate keys.
- `XBRL`. Extraction of Business Financial Information from XBRL Documents

## Data editing and imputation

\scriptsize

- `validate`. Rule management and data validation.
- `validatetools` Checking and simplifying sets of validation rules.
- `errorlocate` Error localisation based on the principle of Fellegi and Holt.
Uses validate rule definitions
supports categorical and/or numeric data
supports linear equalities, inequalities and conditional rules.
Configurable backend for MIP-based error localization.
- `VIM`. Visualisation and Imputation of missing values.
Advanced visualisation of missing data patterns
Imputation using (robust) linear regression methods
Imputation using several donor-based methods (kNN, hot-deck)

##

\scriptsize

- `simputation`. Simple imputation: many methods using a uniform interface following the tidy tools manifesto
Allows to easily combiny many imputation methods/strategies.
Supports regression (standard, M-estimation, ridge/lasso/elasticnet), hot-deck methods (powered by VIM), randomForest, EM-based, and iterative randomForest imputation. Reuse of fitted models and definition of simple user-defined methods are supported as well.
- `SeleMix`. Detection of outliers and influential errors using a latent variable model for selective editing.
- `univOutl`. Various methods for detecting univariate outliers.
- extremevalues. Detection of univariate outliers based on modeling the bulk distribution.
- `deductive`: Deductive correction and imputation using edit rules and (partially) complete data.
- `rspa`: Adapt Numerical Records to Fit (in)Equality Restrictions.

- `rsae`: Small area estimation based on (robust) maximum likelihood estimation.
- `CalibrateSSB`: Calculate weighs and estimates for panel data with non-response.
- `ReGenesees`: Has a similar interface as the - `survey`: along with specific features (e.g. partitioned calibration) that make it fit for processing large-scale surveys in the official statistics field. ReGenesees implements many different estimators with sampling errors, and ships with a dedicated GUI (package ReGenesees.GUI).
- `vardpoor`: Linearization of non-linear statistics and variance estimation.
- `convey`: Variance estimation on indicators of income concentration and poverty using complex sample survey designs. Wrapper around the survey package.
- `icarus`: Provides detailed tools for performing calibration and several of its varitations, in a familiar setting for Calmar users in SAS.
- `gustave`: Provides a toolkit for analytical variance estimation in survey sampling.
- `rtrim`: Trends and Indices for Monitoring data. Provides tools for estimating animal/plant populations based on site counts, including occurrence of missing data.
- `surveysd`: Calibration, bootstrap and error estimation for complex surveys.
- `inca`: Calibration weighting with integer weights.

## Time series and seasonal adjustment (GSBPM 5.6 | 5.7)

\scriptsize

- `seasonal`: Interface to the X13-ARIMA-SEATS program from R with a very nice shiny GUI.
- `x12`: Alternative interface to the X13-ARIMA-SEATS program from R with a focus on batch processing time series.
- `RJDemetra`:R interface to JDemetra+.
