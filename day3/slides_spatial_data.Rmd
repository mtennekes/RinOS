## Spatial data

Data often has a spatial component:
  
- differences in income between municipalities/neighborhoods
- population density
- companies, high tech, agricultural
- road density
- mobility, migration
- land use etc.

You are often interested in (the relevance of) areas or locations.

## GIS

- Software for geographical data is called GIS.
- _Geographical Information Systems_
- Broad umbrella term for spatial analysis, processing and *cartography*
- Cartography is only part of this


## Software

- Desktop GIS software: ArcGIS (ESRI), QGIS, GRASS
- Python (libraries: geopandas, shapely, pyproj, geojson, etc.)
- R (libraries: sf, terra, stars, tmap, mapview, etc.)

## R Spatial

- Group of developers of spatial data analysis R packages
- Main persons: Roger Bivand, Edzer Pebesma, and Robert Hijmans
- Large community (active on GitHub and StackOverflow)



## Spatial vector data

Spatial vector data represent spatial objects:

### Example vector data

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/vector-data-model-1.png}

One feature (row in the data) may contain several points/lines/polygons.


## Spatial raster data

Spatial raster data represent spatial phenomena using a continuous grid of cells

### Basic representation

## Types of raster grids

Raster data does not have to be regular

\end{block}

Non-regular grids are typically obtained after reprojection (more on this later)

##

A satellite image is an example of raster data

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/rgb-raster-1.png}

It shows the three color bands and a composite image using the three bands


## Spatio-temporal data

- Spatio-temporal data are spatial data with a time dimension
- These data are used for spatial data analysis over time
- Such data can be stored in a data cube


## Raster data cube

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/raster-data-cubes-1.png}

Example: weather data with attributes: temperature, preceptation, and air pressure


## Vector data cube

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/vector-data-cubes-1.png}

Example: land use percentages grouped by administrative region



## Map projections (CRS)

How to flatten a three dimensional object?

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/orange_world.png}

## One approach to flatten the Earth

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/crs-goode-1.png}

Formally known as the _Goode homolosien projection_


## CRS: coordinate reference system

- The CRS (coordinate reference system) contains information where each point on earth is located on a two-dimensional map (x-y coordinates)
- All maps use a CRS
- E.g. in the Netherlands, this is often the National Triangle System (EPSG: 28992)


## CRS: does it matter?

### Yes

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/crs-bias-1.png}

Left: Web Mercator (used in many interactive maps)
Right: Eckert IV projection

For statistical purposes, the second is better

## CRS: main four types

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/crs-types-1.png}

## CRS: properties

\scriptsize

| Property | Conformal | Equal area | Equidistant | Azimuthal |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Preserves	| Local angle (shape) | Area | Distance | Direction |
| Application |	Navigation, climate	| Statistics | Geology	Geology |
| Examples (cyclindrical)	| Mercator | Gall-Peters, Eckert IV | Equirectangular	| none |
| Examples (conic)	| Lambert conformal conic | Albers conic | Equidistant conic | none |
| Examples (planar)	| Stereographic	| Lambert azimuthal equal-area | Azimuthal equidistant | Stereographic, Lambert azimuthal equal-area |
| Examples (interrupted)	| Myriahedral	| Goode homolosine, Myriahedral | none | none |

## CRS: World maps

For thematic World maps, pseudo-cylindrical projections are used:

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/crs-robin-1.png}

- This is the Robinson projection
- These projecions are pseudo-cylindrical
- They are equal-area, important for statistics


## Vector data in R: `sf` package

Data is a "data.frame" with an additional "geometry" column.

### read/write

- `st_read` read (many) different formats: geojson, geopackage and shp (ESRI)
- `st_write` write to different formats

### Manipulate

- `create, modify, association, intersection etc. of" geometry "

### Calculate

- buffer query, interpolation, etc


## Raster data in R: `terra` package
